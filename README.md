Ansible Samples
-----

*A repo with understandable Ansible examples, which can be executed locally.*

All `hosts` in this repo are `localhost` of your operating machine. Personally, I found myself spending much more time on things other than `ssh` when I learnt Ansible. If you have trouble with remote-in, defining or grouping the hosts, please take a look at [the offical Ansible doc](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/).
